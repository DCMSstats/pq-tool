Overall performance is reviewed at regular contract meetings with officials and by the Civil Service Pensions Board which includes industry experts and nominees of Civil Service employers and scheme members.<strong> </strong></p><p>Further to my answer of 8 January 2015 to the hon. Member for Leicester South about pre-existing issues, MyCSP took responsibility for the administration of the pensioner payroll from the previous supplier and inherited an unexpectedly large backlog of work. This caused a temporary dip in performance and some pension payments were delayed as a result. The Cabinet Office has instructed MyCSP to prioritise ensuring delayed payments are resolved quickly and returning service levels to normal as quickly as possible.</p><p>MyCSP vested as a MJV in May 2012 which permitted the injection of much needed new investment in IT, capability and technology into MyCSP. None of the recent service issues are as a result of the MJV model. The transformation this investment is enabling will allow MyCSP to deliver a wider range of services (including online services) to higher standards whilst halving the cost of pension administration within 10 years. Even before this transformation is fully completed (and whilst continuing to work with legacy systems and problems inherited from the predecessor organisation), MyCSP has improved productivity by 15% year-on-year since 2012, driven down staff absenteeism, while also improving staff engagement.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em> </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong><em> </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong><em> </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong><em> </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong><em> </em></strong></p><p> </p>","Davidson, Ian","Labour (Co-op)","Glasgow South West","Maude, Francis",2015-01-12,2015-01-19,828,"delivery, performance, set"

These rules include:</p><p>· we will no longer let ICT contracts over £100 million in value – unless there is an exceptional reason to do so. Contracts should be smaller to ensure the widest possible range of suppliers can compete for them.</p><p>· we will not give a contract for service provision to a company providing the system integration function in the same part of government.
